Pizza Clicker by Neal Vander Does
=======================================

Introduction
------------
The Pizza Clicker app is my attempt to create a small clicker game.
The app will include an upgrade to increase the price of the pizza, earning you 
more money for each click.

Important Info
--------------
After buying the upgrade, refresh the pizza by clicking it.

I have included the Main Activity as the home-screen with the clickable pizza, I have the Secondary
Activity as the upgrade section. The Settings button houses Home screen the Preferences button. The 
Preferences button takes you to the Preferences screen, which holds the Prestige and Reset buttons.
