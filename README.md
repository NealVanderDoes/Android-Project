Pizza Clicker by Neal Vander Does
=======================================

Introduction
------------
The Pizza Clicker app is my attempt to create a small clicker game.
The app will include upgrades to increase the price of the pizza, earning you 
more money for each click.

Important Info
--------------
It is a bit broken, but I have some semi-working features. I have 1 upgrade displaying right now
for testing. The upgrade works when you purchase it, you just have to click the pizza once to 
update it and you will start making 5 per click instead of 1. It stays purchasable after you buy 
it, so I'm still working on fixing that.

I have included the Main Activity as the home-screen with the clickable pizza, I have the Secondary
Activity as the upgrades section. I have the button for Help/Settings placed down, but it has no 
functionality as of yet. I plan to include the Preferences button within the Help/Settings menu.
